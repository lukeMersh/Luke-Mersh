<p> My name is Luke Mersh.<br/>
I am a self-taught freelance Wordpress developer.<br/>
I have started to learn about Git and GitHub and how to use version control.<br/>
I have never used Version control or project management before with any of my projects,<br/>
  so I am learning how to use Github to project manange any new projects I aquire.</p><br/>
  I am working on my WordPress plugin development which I hope to be able to do using git and github <br/>
  as well as Local by Flywheel for my local development platform.
